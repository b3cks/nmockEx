<h3> Latest Stable Release </h3>

<p> NMock 2.0 is the latest release and has been rewritten to support a <a href="http://jmock.codehaus.org/">jMock</a> style of expectation definition and verification. If you're using the .NET 2.0 framework, NMock2 supports use of generics in a few places to make life easier. </p>

<p> NMock 1.x is no longer being actively maintained, but if you have a question you should still be able to get answers on the mailing list. Head over to the <a href="support.html">support</a> page if you have a problem. </p>

<h3> Live Builds </h3>

<p> We continuously build NMock using <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET">CruiseControl.NET</a>. To see the current build status, check out the <a href="http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/default.aspx?_action_ViewProjectReport=true&server=local&project=NMock2">CCNet Live</a> build page. To download a recent build, try the <a href="http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/NMock2%2Dbuilds/">builds directory</a>, but bear in mind that these are &#0147;bleeding edge&#0148; builds and not official releases. </p>


<h3>Version Numbering</h3>

<p>The NMock project follows strict rules that govern its use of version
numbers.  The version number of a release indicates how that release is
compatible with previous and future releases.</p>

<p>Version numbers have the form <var>major</var>.<var>minor</var>.<var>patch</var>. The major version number
identifies the API version.  A release that changes the API in a way that
breaks backwards compatibility will increment the major version number.
The minor version number
identifies the backwards compatible revision of the API.  An API version that
adds new elements to the API will have the same major version but will increment the
minor version.  The patch version number
identifies revisions that do not change the API.  A release that fixes bugs
or refactors implementation details without changing the API will have the
same minor and major versions as the previous release and increment the patch
number.</p>

<p>A hypothetical example:</p>

<table class="versions">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1.0.0</td>
      <td>First release</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1.0.1</td>
      <td>Improves documentation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1.1.0</td>

      <td>Adds new API elements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1.2.0</td>
      <td>Adds new API elements, deprecates some API elements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>1.2.1</td>
      <td>Fixes bugs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2.0.0</td>
      <td>Incompatible API changes, removes API elements deprecated by
        version 1.2.0.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>2.1.0</td>
      <td>Adds new API elements</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>etc.</td>
      <td>etc.</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Release Candidates</h3>

<p>Before a new major or minor release, NMock will make release candidate
(RC) packages available so that users can test them against their own code.
There will be one or more release candidates given the version
<var>major</var>.<var>minor</var>.0.RC<var>n</var>, where the major and minor
version numbers identify the upcoming release and RC1 identifies the first
candidate release, RC2 the second, and so on.</p>

<p>A release candidate does not guarantee backward compatability with new API
features introduced by any previous RC of the same upcoming version. A major
version RC can change/remove API features introduced in a previous RC for the
same major version;  a minor version RC can change API features introduced by
any previous RC of the same upcoming minor version but guarantees backward
compatability with the previous minor version.</p>
