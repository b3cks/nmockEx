<p>NMock is a dynamic <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/">mock object</a> library for .NET. Mock objects make it easier to test single components&#8212;often single classes&#8212;without relying on real implementations of all of the other components. This means we can test just one class, rather than a whole tree of objects, and can pinpoint bugs much more clearly. Mock objects are often used during <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment">Test Driven Development</a>. </p>

<p> <strong>NMock 2.0 Release Candidate 2</strong> is now available! The original NMock was a .NET port of the Java-based DynaMock, whereas NMock 2.0 is inspired by the newer <a href="http://www.jmock.org/">jMock</a> library. Expectations are defined using a much more &#0147;conversational&#0148; style, including plenty of syntactic sugar to improve clarity. </p>

<p>A dynamic mock object:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>takes on the interface of another object, allowing it to be substituted for a real one for testing purposes.</li>

      <li>allows <em>expectations</em> to be defined, specifying how the class under test is expected to interact with the mock.</li>

      <li>fails the test if any of the expectations are violated.</li>

      <li>can also act as a <em>stub</em>, allowing the test to specify objects to be returned from mocked methods.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Features specific to NMock:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>expectations are specified beforehand and verified on the fly as the code under test is being executed, rather than afterwards using assertions. This has the advantage that mocks <em><a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/failFast.pdf">fail fast</a></em>, allowing you to easily pinpoint the exact point the test failed, using a stack trace or debugger.</li>

      <li>mock implementations of interfaces are generated on the fly at runtime, which avoids having to add a code generation step to the build.</li>

      <li>error messages clearly show the reason for the failure.</li>

      <li>flexible expectations can be built up using the constraint library.</li>

    </ul>

<p> The best way to see how NMock works is to read the <a href="quickstart.html">Quickstart</a> (5 minutes) or the <a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial</a> (15 minutes).
